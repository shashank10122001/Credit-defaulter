# Credit-defaulter

## A Binary Classifier to detect credit defaulters

Built a Binary Classifier with a unique combination of datasets to predict if it was safe for a bank to loan them money or not. We had to use both the user demographic data which was provided with anonymous labels along with the user payment history data. 

The binary classifier used oversampling and undersampling to balance out the data, it also consisted of some EDA using Pandas and manipulating the data to get better results. 
We also used and tested a wide array of models and tuned hyperparameters using GridsearchCV. After multiple tries, We found the Gradient Boost algorithm to give the best results.
